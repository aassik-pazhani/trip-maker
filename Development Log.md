Week 1-Nov 21st

This week, our team decided on our project goals and and completed our team contract. 
We also set up our workspace, which included cloning the provided demo repo and started brainstorming
on how to implement graphs. We discussed the basic methods of how to implement a graph, such as creating 
a graph with the nodes as the airports and the edges as the direct flights/routes between airports. 
For next week, we will study implementation of graphs and start implementing it this week.
